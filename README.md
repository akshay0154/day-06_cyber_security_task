## üß™ Password Strength Test Results

| Password               | Strength     | Crack Time         
|------------------------|--------------|-------------------
| `Akshay@12345`         | Weak         | 1 hour            
| `Akshay@2005`          | Medium       | 30 hours          
| `A@8599072171`         | Strong       | 1 month           
| `j8AmeyA4VEDJg@k`      | Very Strong  | 7 billion years   

All passwords were tested on **PasswordMonster.com**.

## üîç Key Learnings

### ‚úÖ Tips for Creating a Strong Password by **PasswordMonster.com**
- Use **at least 12‚Äì15 characters**.
- Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**.
- Avoid dictionary words, names, or birth years.
- Never reuse old passwords on different platforms.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes
- Using personal names or predictable patterns (`Akshay@12345`).
- Short passwords.
- Repeating the same password across multiple sites.

### Brute Force Attack
Tries all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found.
The shorter and simpler the password, the faster it can be cracked.
Can be slowed down significantly with long and complex passwords.

### Dictionary Attack
Uses a predefined list of common words and known passwords.
Fast and effective against passwords like Akshay123, Password2024, etc.
Easily defeated by using non-dictionary words and random strings.

## How Password Complexity Affects Security
High complexity = stronger defense. Passwords with a mix of characters are much harder to guess or crack.
Increased length and randomness exponentially raise the time required to break a password using brute-force.
A complex password like j8AmeyA4VEDJg@k takes billions of years to crack, whereas a simple one like Akshay@12345 may take just 1 hour.
Complexity makes passwords more resistant to automated attacks and pattern analysis.
Ultimately, complexity and unpredictability reduce the risk of both manual and automated password attacks.
